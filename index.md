## A bit about myself

Hello everyone, my name is Duo (George) Cheng, and I am currently a first year Bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT. Here's some of my basic details below: <br> 
In the mean time you are welcome to contact me at S3899254@student.rmit.edu.au.

Student ID: S3899254

Previous education: Completion of VCE (Year 12) at Glen Waverley Secondary College in Melbourne's eastern suburbs.

One fun fact about myself: Apart from IT, I also have an active interest in reading the history of Central and Eastern Europe from 1500s, as reflected by my GitHub username, Transcarpathia, which is a region in western Ukraine, formerly part of Austria-Hungary before WWI, and Czechoslovakia before WWII.

## Interest in IT

**What is your interest in IT?**

I have always been fascinated with computer, which is something that you spend many hours a day on. Many people may not realise this, but your smartphone is a powerful mobile computer that performs faster than a desktop just 3 years ago, while it is much smaller.

**When did your interest in IT start?**

My interest in IT began very long ago, when I started using computers, to browse things and play some games. However, for the coding part, I am only getting started, so more focus on that part is needed.

**Outline your IT experience (if any).**

Everyone had some IT experience even if they don't realise any. The use of mobile phones and computers on a daily basis is a big part of it. Other than that, I've also had some command in coding a simple program, both in Python and Visual Basic (very outdated, but someone will know).

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

RMIT offers an industry-ready experience for every student, especially in IT, where student can put their skills in use in the real world, both during the school life, but also in workplaces post graduation.

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

I have always expected to learn advanced coding, in order to create a relatively complex. But also cyber security to fend off malign actors' attacks on valuable internet properties, such as financial tranactions and private data.

## Ideal job

https://www.seek.com.au/job/51786574?type=standout#searchRequestToken=933e1e64-6e09-452d-911a-9745023071de

This role offered will require the ideal candidate to manage cybersecurity across multiple units, navigating complex web systems used by different sub units of a government department, provide expert IT security advice against malicious activities to the government department, and fend off attacks if necessary.

The skills involved includes tertiary degree in cybersecurity or equivalent, working knowledge of data security standards, as well as considerable prior experience in managing IT risks and provision of IT security advices. Based on my current level, while navigating threats are potentially a simultaneous strength and challenge, I will have to gain deeper understanding of current and emerging information threats, as well as real life experience in managing IT risks, before I can apply for this position.

## Personality test

I have completed 3 personality tests, all of them as a tool for others to gain a deeper understanding of myself. They are:

1. Myers-Briggs test;
2. Learning style test; and
3. Big Five personality test.
